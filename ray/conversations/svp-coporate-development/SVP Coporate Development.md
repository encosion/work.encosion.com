## Intro

I want to give you a high-level overview of the SVP, Corporate Development role we're hiring for on the West Coast. This is a senior, high-impact position that sits at the intersection of strategy, innovation, and execution — and it's a really exciting moment for the business.

Role is Under Tony Driscoll, EVP Corporate Strategy and Corporate Development- (review vision for the team & structure: SVPs CD/CS/SA)

We're building a corporate development function that's deeply integrated with our broader strategic vision. The idea is to run the team as a pool of general resources — no silos — so everyone gets exposure to different types of work, whether it's transactions, partnerships, or strategic planning. It's collaborative, it's dynamic, and it's designed to be efficient and engaging.

This role specifically is focused on the West Coast, based in LA, and we're looking for someone who brings a big tech or tech-adjacent background — someone who understands that world, has operated in it, or has serviced it. You'll be working on a wide variety of projects, including some next-gen opportunities, partnering with many different types of organizations, really helping us shape the future of where entertainment and technology intersect.

We need someone who's not just a deal executor, but a strategic thinker — someone who can see around corners, anticipate where the industry is going, and help us get there. You'll be expected to run full M&A processes pretty independently: building the thesis, engaging banks, managing diligence, and closing deals. So we're looking for someone with a strong track record of leading transactions end-to-end.

Culturally, this is a team of entrepreneurial, high-capacity individuals. Expectations are high, and the pace is fast. Everyone here is "all in" — we're passionate about what we're building and excited to be part of something transformative. So if you're comfortable with and sort of energized by ambiguity, love building new things and transforming, and want to help change the industry - this is the place.

We also care deeply about team dynamics. Tony wants smart, humble, hungry people — no egos, no sharp elbows. Collaboration is key, and we're building a group that's supportive, driven, and aligned around a shared vision.
