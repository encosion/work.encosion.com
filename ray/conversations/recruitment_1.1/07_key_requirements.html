<p>Great, I've extracted some key criteria:</p>
<p>Candidates must-have the following core skills: <strong>Agile methodologies</strong>, <strong>Product roadmap development</strong>, <strong>Stakeholder management</strong> and <strong>User story creation</strong></p>
<p>Ideal companies to start sourcing from should be: <strong>Microsoft</strong>, <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Amazon</strong> or <strong>Salesforce</strong>.</p>
<p>Does this sound about right?</p>
