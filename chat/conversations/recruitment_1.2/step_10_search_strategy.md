Fantastic. I've created a set of searches, starting with the most focused and then widening in scope. Each search varies job titles and companies to help you find different candidate profiles:

### Exact â€¢ *Results loaded* ðŸ‘‰
**Roles:** Direct job title synonyms â€“ Sr/Senior Product Owner, Lead Product Owner

### Closest â€¢ **[View results](link)**
**Roles:** Related roles in the same domain â€“ Senior Product Manager, Scrum Master, Agile Project Lead, Senior Project Manager, Senior Programme Manager

Are these enough for you? Would you like broader the search or would you like to make some changes?
