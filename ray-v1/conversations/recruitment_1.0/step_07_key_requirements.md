Great, I've extracted some key criteria:

Candidates must-have the following core skills: **Agile methodologies**, **Product roadmap development**, **Stakeholder management** and **User story creation**

Ideal companies to start sourcing from should be: **Microsoft**, **Google**, **Amazon** or **Salesforce**.

Does this sound about right?
