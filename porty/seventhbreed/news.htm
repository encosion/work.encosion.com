    </font>Hi and welcome to our web site. Our last gig was at the Stilbay, Freedom Biker Rally <font color="#808033">((1000 bikers))</font> not really biker music, but it was fun. <font color="#808033">IMPORTANT</font> news, we have decided on a music style change, which has resulted in a line up change, Ziggy has left the band and Werner Beukes has joined. The music has changed to a funkier groovier sound - no moshing just grooving. Don't worry its not slow - its fast groovy beats with running baselines - the guitar has been toned down to include ripping verses and pop choruses - very exciting.</p>
