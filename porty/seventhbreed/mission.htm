  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">First and foremost we work at fullfilling the corporate vision of <font color="#808033">Focal Point Church</font>, New Covenant Ministries Int. <font color="#808033">((Isiah 60))</font>. We do this with all dilligence by Emile, Werner and Francois being homecell leaders and Wynand trainee homecell leader, Tim and Jannie by serving the body in sound duties for church meetings.<br>
  <br>
  After being good and faithful servants in doing this, we hope to be released into our own band vision which follows:<br>
  <br>
  Our hearts desire is to be submitted to a local church <font color="#808033">((which we are at Focal Point))</font> and to be send out as an evangelical or outreach tool where there will be homecell leaders present to take down the names of the people who get saved, and follow them up eventually slotting them into our church <font color="#808033">((or any New Covenant Church closest to the venue of the show))</font>.<br>
  <br>
  Our desire is to reach the alternative generation of Cape Town as well as the whole of South Africa and by the grace of God all the nations of earth. Our sole purpose of playing music is to glorify God and secondly spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ. <font color="#808033">((Rom. 10:10, 13, 14, 17))</font> "For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For "whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved". How then shall they call on Him whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God." <font color="#808033">((Rom. 1 : 16))</font> "For I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes," So <font color="#808033">((we believe))</font> if we preach the gospel at a show or sing the Word of God through our music then we give the people an opportunity to hear, and thus believe and receive God as their Lord and saviour.<br>
  <br>
  Our longterm vision is to travel to the nations and join in a New Covenant church-plant-team, being homecell leaders or serving the Body and playing live shows, incorporating the people who get saved into that particular church-plant.<br>
  <br>
  We would also like to be a worship team in ourselves to play in our local church <font color="#808033">((Focal Point))</font> or travel with the pastor <font color="#808033">((Steven Pienaar or others))</font> when they preach out as a band or worship team, or at live shows if we feel the Spirit is leading us as such.
